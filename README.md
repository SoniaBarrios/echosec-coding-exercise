# Echosec Coding Exercise

## Task

Using the [API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/Documentation), create a Vue.js application that allows users to search for A Song of Ice and Fire characters and display them within the application.

## Requirements

- Typing a character name in the search bar should show all results for that character.
- If the user hits enter with no character name, all results should be displayed from the API response.
- Display the name, alias, gender, culture, date of birth, date of death (if present), and allegiances for each character returned.

## Development Box

A recent version of node.js is required. The coding example was tested and run on `v10.13.0`.

To install the dependencies run `npm install`.

You can then run `npm run serve` to re-compile your changes in real time or `npm run build` to see the changes after the fact.
